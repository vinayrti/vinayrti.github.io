This website respects the privacy of its visitors and is committed to handling information responsibly.

This site does not knowingly collect personal data for tracking or marketing purposes, nor does it use third-party analytics or advertising cookies.  
However, like most websites, limited technical information (such as IP addresses, browser type, and access timestamps) may be processed automatically by the hosting provider for security, maintenance, and performance purposes.

If you choose to contact the site owner via email, any personal information you voluntarily share (such as your email address) is used **solely for the purpose of responding to your query** and is not shared with third parties or used for unsolicited communication.

This website does not sell, rent, or trade personal information.  

No personal data is intentionally retained beyond what is necessary for communication or legal compliance.

This Privacy Policy may be updated periodically to reflect changes in website practices or applicable laws.
