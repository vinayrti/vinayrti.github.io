**IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA**

**CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION**

**CIVIL APPEAL NO. 5665/2014**

**INSTITUTE OF COMPANIES**

**SECRETARIES OF INDIA …Appellant**

**VERSUS**

**PARAS JAIN …Respondent**

**O R D E R**

**1. This appeal is directed against the order dated**

**22.04.2014 of the Delhi High Court wherein, while allowing**

**the Letters Patent Appeal, filed by the respondent herein, it**

**set aside Guideline No.3 notified by the statutory council of**

**appellant–Institute of Companies Secretaries of India and**

**directed it to charge fee prescribed as per Rule 4 of the**

**Right to Information (Regulation of Fee and Cost) Rules,**

**2005.**

**2. The factual matrix of the case is that the respondent**

**appeared in the final examination for Company Secretary**

**conducted by the Appellant in December, 2012. On being**

**unsuccessful in qualifying the examination, the respondent**

**made an application under the Right to Information Act for2**

**inspection of his answer sheets and subsequently, sought**

**certified copies of the same from the appellant. The**

**appellant thereafter has demanded Rs.500/­ per answer**

**sheet payable for supply of certified copy(ies) of answer**

**book(s) and Rs.450/­ per answer book for providing**

**inspection thereof respectively as per Guideline No.3**

**notified by the statutory council of the appellant. It is to be**

**noted that the respondent obtained the said information**

**under the Right to Information Act, 2005.**

**3. Being aggrieved by the demand made by the**

**appellant, the respondent preferred a Writ Petition before**

**the Delhi High Court wherein the Learned Single Judge**

**dismissed the petition. A Letters Patent Appeal was**

**thereafter preferred by the respondent wherein, the**

**Division Bench quashed Guideline No.3 notified by the**

**appellant and held that the appellant can charge only the**

**prescribed fee under Rule 4, The Right to Information**

**(Regulation of Fees and Cost) Rules, 2005.**

**4. The short issue before us is when the answer scripts**

**of appellant’s examination is sought whether the fee**

**prescribed under Rule 4 of the Right to Information**

**(Regulation of Fee and Cost) Rules, 2005 payable or that3**

**under Guideline No. 3 of the Guideline, Rules and**

**Procedures for Providing Inspection and/or Supply of**

**Certified Copy(ies) of Answer Book(s) to Students, framed**

**by the Examination Committee of appellant’s statutory**

**Council at its 148th Meeting held on 14.08.2013.**

**5. The learned counsel appearing on behalf of the**

**appellant argued that it is undisputed that the Right to**

**Information Act, 2005 is applicable to the appellant.**

**However, in light of specific guidelines formulated under**

**the Company Secretaries Act, 1980, the same should be**

**applicable and not that which is provided under the Right**

**to Information Act. He further contends that owing to**

**quashing of Guideline No. 3 by the Division Bench of Delhi**

**High Court, the appellant cannot collect any amount of fee**

**except the one prescribed under Rule 4, The Right to**

**Information (Regulation of Fees and Cost) Rules, 2005**

**which adds to financial strain on the appellant.**

**6. On the other hand, the learned counsel appearing on**

**behalf of the respondent submitted that any candidate who**

**seeks his answer scripts under Right to Information Act,**

**2005 can only be charged under Rule 4, The Right to**

**Information (Regulation of Fees and Cost) Rules, 2005.4**

**Further, the learned counsel submits that the candidates**

**must have a choice to seek the answer scripts either by the**

**avenue under Right to Information Act or under the**

**Guidelines of the appellant framed by the examination**

**committee of statutory Council under the Company**

**Secretaries Act, 1980.**

**7. Having heard the learned counsels appearing for the**

**parties and we have also meticulously perused the record.**

**8. The appellant is governed by the provisions of**

**Company Secretaries Act, 1980 and under Sections 15,**

**15A and 17, the Examination Committee of the statutory**

**Council has framed Guideline No. 3 providing an avenue to**

**the candidates to either inspect their answer scripts or seek**

**certified copies of the same on payment of the stipulated**

**fees. Guideline no.3 stipulates payment of Rs. 500 for**

**obtaining certified copies and Rs. 450 for seeking**

**inspection of the same.**

**“3. Fee of 500 per subject/answer books ₹**

**payable for supply of certified copy(ies) of**

**answer book(s) and 450 per answer book ₹**

**for providing inspection thereof**

**respectively. The fee shall be paid through**

**Demand Draft drawn in favour of “The**

**Institute of Company Secretaries of India”,**

**payable at New Delhi.”5**

**9. On the contrary, Rule 4, The Right to Information**

**(Regulation of Fees and Cost) Rules, 2005 stipulates,**

**“4. For providing the information under**

**sub­section**

**(1) of section 7, the fee shall be charged by**

**way of cash against proper receipt or by**

**demand draft or bankers cheque or Indian**

**Postal Order payable to the Accounts**

**Officer of the public authority at the**

**following rates:—**

**(a) rupees two for each page (in A4 or A3**

**size paper) created or copied;**

**(b) actual charge or cost price of a copy in**

**larger size paper;**

**(c) actual cost or price for samples or**

**models; and**

**(d) for inspection of records, no fee for**

**the first hour; and a fee of rupees five**

**for each subsequent hour (or fraction**

**thereof).”**

**(emphasis supplied)**

**10. Thus it is clear that the avenue for seeking certified**

**copies as well as inspection is provided both in the Right to**

**Information Act as well as the statutory guidelines of the**

**appellant.**

**11. We are cognizant of the fact that guidelines of the**

**appellant, framed by its statutory council, are to govern the**

**modalities of its day­to­day concerns and to effectuate**

**smooth functioning of its responsibilities under the**

**Company Secretaries Act, 1980. The guidelines of the6**

**appellant may provide for much more than what is provided**

**under the Right to Information Act, such as re­evaluation,**

**re­totaling of answer scripts.**

**12. Be that as it may, Guideline no.3 of the appellant**

**does not take away from Rule 4, The Right to Information**

**(Regulation of Fees and Cost) Rules, 2005 which also**

**entitles the candidates to seek inspection and certified**

**copies of their answer scripts. In our opinion, the existence**

**of these two avenues is not mutually exclusive and it is up**

**to the candidate to choose either of the routes. Thus, if a**

**candidate seeks information under the provisions of the**

**Right to Information, then payment has to be sought under**

**the Rules therein, however, if the information is sought**

**under the Guidelines of the appellant, then the appellant is**

**at liberty to charge the candidates as per its guidelines.**

**13. The appellant has submitted that the Division Bench**

**of Delhi High Court erred in quashing Guideline no.3 which**

**is affecting not only the appellant but also the candidates.**

**Taking into consideration the fact that such quashing was**

**done despite no prayer being made to that effect on behest**

**of the respondent, we hold that quashing of Guideline No.3**

**was unwarranted. It is to this limited extent that we allow7**

**the appeal and set aside the impugned order of Division**

**Bench of Delhi High Court whereby it quashed Guideline**

**No.3.**

**14. Learned counsel appearing for the appellant further**

**submitted that owing to nominal fee fixed under the Right**

**to Information Act, the dissemination of information by the**

**appellant has become financially burdensome and he wants**

**to make a representation to the Government for enhancing**

**the fee prescribed under the Right to Information Act. It is**

**left open to him to make such a representation.**

**15. The appeal is disposed of in the afore­stated terms**

**and pending applications, if any, shall also stand disposed**

**of.**
