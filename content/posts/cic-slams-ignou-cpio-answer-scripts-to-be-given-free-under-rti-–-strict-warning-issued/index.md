# 📌 CIC Orders IGNOU to Provide Answer Scripts FREE Under RTI — Strict Warning to CPIO

In an important and much-needed decision, the Central Information Commission (CIC) has held that IGNOU must provide evaluated answer scripts strictly under the RTI Act, rather than diverting applicants to its internal portal.
The order was delivered by Hon’ble Information Commissioner **Smt. Anandi Ramalingam** on **28 November 2025** in *Second Appeal No. CIC/IGNOU/A/2024/642539*.

---

## 🔍 What the Appellant Had Requested

The appellant had sought certified copies of his evaluated answer sheets for various courses of the June 2024 TEE.
Instead of processing the RTI request, IGNOU directed him to apply only through their “official link,” which is outside the RTI framework. This refusal became the core issue before the Commission.

---

## 📜 Key Findings of the CIC

### 1️⃣ Answer Scripts Are “Information” Under RTI

The CIC relied on two major Supreme Court judgments:

* **CBSE vs. Aditya Bandopadhyay**
* **ICSI vs. Paras Jain**

Both rulings clearly affirm that evaluated answer scripts fall within the definition of “information” under the RTI Act and can be denied only under Sections 8 or 9 — which did not apply here.

---

### 2️⃣ Fee Must Be Charged Only as per RTI Rules

IGNOU’s practice of directing applicants to its internal system was rejected.
The Commission reiterated the Supreme Court’s principle:

**“The existence of two avenues is not mutually exclusive — the candidate may choose either.”**

Therefore, if an applicant chooses RTI, the fee must be charged strictly as per the RTI Rules (₹2 per page), and not as per institutional rules.

---

### 3️⃣ CIC Issues Strict Warning to the CPIO

The Commission strongly criticized the CPIO for:

* Handling the RTI casually
* Providing a reply not based on the RTI Act
* Remaining absent during the hearing
* Not filing any written submission

A **strict warning** was issued, with a clear caution that such conduct may attract **penalty under Section 20** of the RTI Act.

---

### 4️⃣ Information to Be Provided FREE of Cost

Because the CPIO dealt with the request in a manner contrary to law, the CIC directed that the evaluated answer sheets be provided **free of cost** within 15 days.

---

## 📌 Why This Order Matters

This decision reinforces a student’s right to:

* Obtain evaluated answer scripts through RTI
* Avoid being forced into separate institutional procedures
* Pay only the official RTI fees
* Receive legally compliant replies from Public Authorities

It also sends a clear reminder to all universities that **statutory rights under the RTI Act override any internal administrative mechanism**.

## ✍ My View

This is a timely and welcome decision. Many universities still attempt to bypass RTI by imposing their own systems and higher fees. By reiterating the supremacy of the RTI Act, the Commission has given much-needed clarity and relief to students across the country who face similar hurdles.
The order also reinforces accountability among Public Information Officers and ensures that the RTI framework is followed in both letter and spirit.
