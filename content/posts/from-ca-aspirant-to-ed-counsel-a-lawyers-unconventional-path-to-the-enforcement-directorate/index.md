### 


### I. The Lawyer's Journey

* Education: Did his law from Symbiosis Law School, Pune.
* Pre-Law Career: Was pursuing Chartered Accountancy (CA). He realized he preferred legal work over CA work.
* Experience Value: His CA background was highly beneficial, strengthening his knowledge in taxation and accounts for his legal practice.
* Early Practice: Practiced for four years at his father's taxation firm after law school, gaining experience arguing cases.
* Advice from College: Emphasized the importance of practical knowledge gained through good internships over just bookish knowledge.

### II. Joining the Enforcement Directorate (ED)

* Motivation: Applied for a vacancy as a Legal Consultant in 2021 after encouragement from his wife.
* Selection: Went through a process involving a written test and an interview by a panel of ED officials and counsel.
* Confidence: Found motivation in being selected among thousands of applicants.

### III. Work and Process at ED (PMLA)

* Core Responsibilities:

  * Vetting: Checking the legal correctness of all court filings (applications, petitions, replies) for the ED.
  * Legal Opinions: Providing legal counsel on next steps for investigation and complex matters.
* ED Case Process:

  * Prerequisite: The ED cannot initiate a case. There must first be a "Predicated Offense" (Schedule Offense) registered by another agency (State Police, CBI, etc.).
  * Action: Investigation starts with steps like asset attachment and/or filing a Prosecution Complaint (charge sheet).
  * Courts: PMLA cases are heard in specially nominated Special Courts.

### IV. Final Advice to Young Lawyers

* Key Traits: Work hard and be sincere.
* Confidence: Don't let self-doubt stop you; use it to motivate continuous learning.
* Patience: Initial experiences in court can be daunting, but with practice and patience, arguing becomes normal.
* Fraternity Support: The legal community is generally supportive and helpful to young lawyers.
