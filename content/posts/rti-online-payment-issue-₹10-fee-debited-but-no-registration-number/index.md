Dear Friends,

I have come to know that **many applicants are facing issues while making the payment of ₹10/- towards the RTI application fee** on the **RTI Online portal**, especially while applying for **certified copies of answer sheets**.

---

## What Is the Issue?

Due to **intermittent issues with the SBI payment gateway server**, the following situation is occurring:

- The **RTI fee amount is debited** from the applicant’s bank account  
- However, **no RTI Application Registration Number is generated**
- The applicant is left **confused about what to do next**

---

## Important Clarifications

### 1️⃣ Applicants Below Poverty Line (BPL)

If you fall under the **Below Poverty Line (BPL)** category and have valid proof such as:
- Food Security Card  
- Ration Card  
- Any other BPL card issued by the State Authority  

👉 You may **file the RTI application without making any payment**, as permitted under the RTI Act.

---

### 2️⃣ Applicants Not Under BPL Category

If you do **not** fall under the BPL category:
- Payment of ₹10/- is **mandatory**
- There is **no alternative exemption**

---

## ₹10 Debited but No Registration Number? What to Do

If:
- The payment is **successfully debited**, but  
- You **did not receive an RTI Registration Number**

👉 **DO NOT file a fresh RTI application again.**

In most cases:
- The **registration number is generated later**
- It is usually sent **within 1–2 working days** after bank reconciliation

---
