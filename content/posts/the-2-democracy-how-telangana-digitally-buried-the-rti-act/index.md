title: "The 2% Democracy: How Telangana Digitally Buried the RTI Act"
description: Despite a binding Supreme Court order mandating functional online
  RTI portals, Telangana’s RTI system stands dismantled from within. This
  article exposes how deliberate non-implementation, institutional apathy, and
  regulatory sabotage have reduced the RTI Act, 2005 into a symbolic law without
  enforcement.
summary: This article critically examines the collapse of the Right to
  Information regime in Telangana after the launch of the RTI online portal.
  Using official RTI data obtained from the State itself, it demonstrates how
  the portal exists only on paper, how public authorities refuse to use it, how
  appeals remain undecided for years, and how the Information Commission has
  abdicated its constitutional duty—effectively burying democracy through
  silence and inaction.

# Digital Mirage: The Systematic Burial of RTI in Telangana

The Right to Information Act, 2005 was enacted to dismantle the culture of secrecy that long protected corruption and administrative arbitrariness in India. Transparency was not envisioned as a favour by the State, but as a **citizen’s enforceable right**, flowing directly from Articles **14, 19(1)(a), and 21** of the Constitution.

Yet in Telangana, the RTI Act has not been repealed, suspended, or amended away.  
Instead, it has been **quietly neutralised through systemic non-implementation**.

This article documents how the RTI framework in Telangana has collapsed—not through overt defiance, but through silence, delay, non-use, and technical obstruction—using **official data supplied by the Government itself**.

---

## Supreme Court Mandate: Law Without Ambiguity

In **Writ Petition (Civil) No. 1040 of 2019 (Pravasi Legal Cell v. Union of India)**, read with **W.P.(C) No. 1325 of 2020**, the Supreme Court of India issued a binding direction:

> All States and Union Territories shall **set up and operationalize online RTI portals** for all public authorities within their jurisdiction.

The intent was unmistakable:
- Universal digital access
- Elimination of bureaucratic gatekeeping
- Standardised accountability
- Real-time monitoring of RTI compliance

This was not a suggestion.  
It was a **constitutional command**.

---

## Telangana’s Formal Compliance, Substantive Defiance

Telangana launched its RTI portal (**https://rti.telangana.gov.in/**) on **15 December 2022**.

On paper, the State complied.  
In practice, the portal became a **digital mirage**—visible, but unusable.

---

## The Statistical Indictment: RTI Reduced to 2% Reality

As per the official RTI reply issued by the Information Technology, Electronics and Communications (ITE&C) Department:

### RTI Applications (Dec 2022 – Dec 2025)

- **Total RTI Applications Filed:** 17,865  
- **Total RTI Applications Disposed:** 377  

That is a **disposal rate of approximately 2%**.

In effect, **98% of citizens who used the official RTI portal received no final response**.

This is not administrative backlog.  
This is **systemic abandonment**.

---

## First Appeals: A Statutory Remedy That Does Not Function

The collapse is even more severe at the appellate stage:

- **First Appeals Filed:** 2,502  
- **First Appeals Disposed:** **NIL**

Month after month, disposal columns reflect **zero**, rendering the statutory appeal mechanism meaningless. A lone aggregate number appears without explanation, but no month-wise disposal exists.

A right without an effective appeal is **not a right—it is an illusion**.

---

## A Portal Without Participants: 99.5% Non-Usage

Perhaps the most damning disclosure:

- **Public Authorities Onboarded on Portal:** 3,323  
- **Public Authorities Actually Using Portal:** 17  
- **Public Authorities Not Using Portal:** 3,306  

That means **99.5% of Telangana’s public authorities are ignoring the RTI portal**.

This includes the **ITE&C Department itself**—the very authority responsible for developing and maintaining the portal.

Even more disturbing:
- **No notices issued**
- **No compliance directions**
- **No monitoring reports**
- **No enforcement action**

A regulator that does not regulate is not ineffective—it is complicit.

---

## Transparency Locked Behind NDAs

When citizens sought certified copies of:
- Government Orders
- Tenders
- File notes
- Agreements
- Approvals

relating to the RTI portal itself, the response was startling:

> Disclosure denied due to an **existing NDA with the vendor**.

A portal meant to enforce transparency is itself governed by secrecy clauses.

Public money is spent.  
Public infrastructure is created.  
Yet the public is told it cannot know **how, why, or at what cost**.

This defeats the very object of the RTI Act.

---

## The Sleeping Watchdog: Telangana Information Commission

The Telangana State Information Commission is legally mandated to:
- Enforce RTI timelines
- Penalize erring officers
- Protect citizen rights

In reality, it mirrors the paralysis it is meant to correct.

### Personal Case Illustration

- **Second Appeal Filed:** 2023  
- **Hearing Concluded:** 26 November 2025  
- **Order Status (as of 10 January 2026):** Not passed  

Over **40 days after conclusion of arguments**, no order.

High Courts routinely pronounce judgments faster.

When the RTI regulator itself defaults, citizens are forced into constitutional litigation merely to activate a statutory right.

---

## Real-Time Breakdown: Portal Not Functioning

As of January 2026:

- **10,823 citizens are registered** on the Telangana RTI portal
- For the **last two consecutive days**, the portal has been **non-functional**
- **OTPs are not being triggered**
- RTI applications **cannot be submitted**

There is:
- No public notice
- No alternate submission mechanism
- No accountability

When digital access is mandated and the system fails, the State effectively **suspends the RTI Act without authority of law**.

A right that exists only when servers cooperate is **not a right—it is a controlled privilege**.

---

## A 20-Year-Old Law Still Awaiting Implementation

The RTI Act came into force in **2005**.  
It is now **2026**.

If a State is unwilling to:
- Answer RTI applications
- Decide appeals
- Enforce penalties
- Operate its own portal

then an uncomfortable question must be asked:

**If transparency is inconvenient, why not repeal the RTI Act honestly instead of sabotaging it silently?**

Symbolic compliance is more dangerous than repeal—it deceives citizens into believing rights exist when they do not.

---

## Conclusion: Democracy Buried by Silence

There has been:
- No formal repeal
- No suspension notification
- No legislative debate

Instead:
- Applications vanish
- Appeals stagnate
- Authorities ignore
- Commissions sleep
- Portals fail

This is not an administrative lapse.  
It is the **systematic burial of democratic accountability**.

Democracy does not always die loudly.  
Sometimes, it dies quietly—behind “Processing” screens, empty dashboards, and unanswered appeals.

**In Telangana today, the Right to Information has effectively become the Right to Ignore.**
