title: "The 2% Democracy: How Telangana Digitally Buried the RTI Act"
description: Despite a binding Supreme Court order mandating functional online
  RTI portals, Telangana’s RTI system stands dismantled from within. This
  article exposes how deliberate non-implementation, institutional apathy, and
  regulatory sabotage have reduced the RTI Act, 2005 into a symbolic law without
  enforcement.
summary: This article critically examines the collapse of the Right to
  Information regime in Telangana after the launch of the RTI online portal.
  Using official RTI data obtained from the State itself, it demonstrates how
  the portal exists only on paper, how public authorities refuse to use it, how
  appeals remain undecided for years, and how the Information Commission has
  abdicated its constitutional duty—effectively burying democracy through
  silence and inaction.

The **Right to Information Act of 2005** was intended to be the **sunlight that serves as the best disinfectant for corruption.** However, in Telangana, the sun is setting on transparency. 

The Right to Information Act, 2005 was enacted to dismantle the culture of secrecy that long protected corruption and administrative arbitrariness in India. Transparency was not envisioned as a favour by the State, but as a **citizen’s enforceable right**, flowing directly from Articles **14, 19(1)(a), and 21** of the Constitution.

Yet in Telangana, the RTI Act has not been repealed, suspended, or amended away.  
Instead, it has been **quietly neutralised through systemic non-implementation**.

This article documents how the RTI framework in Telangana has collapsed - not through overt defiance, but through silence, delay, non-use, and technical obstruction - using **official data supplied by the Government itself**.

This is not a story of inefficiency. 

This is a story of institutional sabotage.

## Supreme Court Mandate: Law Without Ambiguity

In **Writ Petition (Civil) No. 1040 of 2019 (Pravasi Legal Cell v. Union of India)**, read with **W.P.(C) No. 1325 of 2020**, the Supreme Court of India issued a binding direction:

> All States and Union Territories shall **set up and operationalize online RTI portals** for all public authorities within their jurisdiction within **3 Months.**

The intent was unmistakable:
- Universal digital access
- Elimination of bureaucratic gatekeeping
- Standardised accountability
- Real-time monitoring of RTI compliance

This was not a suggestion.  
It was a **constitutional command**.

---

## Telangana’s Formal Compliance, Substantive Defiance

Telangana launched its RTI portal **https://rti.telangana.gov.in/** on **15th December 2022**.

On paper, the State complied.  
In practice, the portal became a **digital mirage** - visible, but unusable.

## The Statistical Indictment: RTI Reduced to 2% Reality

As per the official RTI reply issued by the Information Technology, Electronics and Communications (ITE&C) Department:

### RTI Applications (Dec 2022 – Dec 2025)

- Total RTI Applications **Filed  : 17,865**  
- Total RTI Applications **Disposed: 377**

That is a **disposal rate of approximately 2%**.

**The Reality:** A staggering **98% of online RTI applications** remain effectively unaddressed or **lost in the digital void.**

This is not administrative backlog.  
This is **administrative abandonment**.

---

## First Appeals: A Statutory Remedy That Does Not Function

The collapse is even more severe at the appellate stage:

- First Appeals **Filed: 2,502**  
- First Appeals **Disposed:** **NIL**

Not one.

Not a single appeal decided.

A statutory remedy reduced to a decorative illusion.

---

## A Portal Without Participants: 99.5% Non-Usage

Perhaps the most damning disclosure:

- Public Authorities **Onboarded on Portal: 3,323** 
- Public Authorities **Actually Using Portal: 17**  
- Public Authorities **Not Using Portal:   3,306**  

That means **99.5% of Telangana’s public authorities are ignoring the RTI portal**.

This includes the **ITE&C Department itself** - the very authority responsible for developing and maintaining the portal.

When the watchdog refuses to watch, corruption doesn’t need protection - it gets permission.

---

## Real-Time Breakdown: Portal Not Functioning

As of January 2026:

- **10,823 citizens are registered** on the Telangana RTI portal
- For the **last two consecutive days**, the portal has been **non-functional**
- **OTPs are not being triggered**
- RTI applications **cannot be submitted**

When digital access is mandated and the system fails, the State effectively **suspends the RTI Act without authority of law**.

A right that exists only when servers cooperate is **not a right - it is a controlled privilege**.

---

## A 20-Year-Old Law Still Awaiting Implementation

The RTI Act is now over 20 years old.

If the State has no intention to implement it, the question must be asked openly:

**If transparency is inconvenient, why not repeal the RTI Act honestly instead of strangling it quietly?**

Symbolic laws with zero enforcement are worse than repealed laws—they deceive citizens into believing rights exist when they do not.

---

## Conclusion: Democracy Buried by Silence

This Is Not About a Portal. This Is About Democracy.

RTI is not a software feature.
RTI is not a department.
RTI is the citizen’s right to question power.

When:

Applications are not answered

Appeals are not heard

Authorities are not monitored

What dies is not transparency alone.

What dies is democracy itself.

This is not an administrative lapse.  
It is the **systematic burial of democratic accountability**.

Democracy does not always die loudly.  
Sometimes, it dies quietly - behind “Processing” screens, empty dashboards, and unanswered appeals.

**In Telangana today, the Right to Information has effectively become the Right to Ignore.**
