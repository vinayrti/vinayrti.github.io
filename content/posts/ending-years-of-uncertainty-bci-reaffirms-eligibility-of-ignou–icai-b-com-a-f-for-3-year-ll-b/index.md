## Ending Years of Uncertainty: IGNOU窶的CAI B.Com (A&F) and LL.B. Eligibility

For more than a decade, students across India, particularly Chartered Accountants and CA aspirants - have faced repeated uncertainty while seeking admission to the **3-Year LL.B. course**, despite holding valid and recognized qualifications.

This issue persisted not because of absence of law, but because of inconsistent interpretation.

---

## The Legal Position Since 2008

The **Bar Council of India Rules of Legal Education, 2008** clearly provide that:

- A first degree obtained from a University established by an Act of Parliament or State Legislature is valid for admission to the 3-Year LL.B.
- Degrees obtained through distance or correspondence mode are permitted.
- Disqualification applies only where a candidate obtained 10+2 or graduation directly through an open university system without possessing the basic or preceding qualification.

Thus, where a student has completed **regular 10+2** and thereafter pursued graduation - even through distance education - the degree remains valid, provided the LL.B. is pursued in **regular mode**.

---

## A Struggle That Began in 2014

As early as **2014**, a Chartered Accountant Karan Joshi holding a **B.Com (Accountancy & Finance)** degree under the **IGNOU窶的CAI MoU** faced denial of LL.B. admission.

After prolonged struggle, the Bar Council of India clarified the position in his favour. However, since this clarification was not issued as a general public circular, the problem continued to resurface every academic year.

Since then, **CA Karan Joshi** has been consistently helping students facing similar issues - quietly guiding, sharing documents, and supporting affected candidates across the country.

---

## A Decade of Confusion and Unequal Treatment

Despite unchanged rules:

- Some universities granted admission.
- Others rejected eligible candidates.
- In certain cases, students were admitted but later denied enrolment by State Bar Councils, even after clearing the AIBE.

Students were left to fight individually for what the law already permitted.

---

## 48,000+ Students Are Impacted

As per a **Press Release issued by the Public Relations Committee of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India on 10 October 2023**, more than **48,000 ICAI students have successfully completed the B.Com (Accountancy & Finance)** programme under the IGNOU窶的CAI MoU.

This is not a marginal issue - it affects thousands of legitimate degree holders nationwide.

---

## My Experience in 2025

In **2025**, I personally faced similar objections during the admission process.

At this stage, I approached **CA Karan Joshi**, who was kind enough to guide me, share relevant precedents, and remain available whenever required. His support was instrumental - not just for me, but for countless students since 2014.

Eventually, after approaching the Bar Council of India, my admission was granted.

---

## A Representation in the Larger Public Interest

Recognising that individual clarifications were not enough, I submitted a **formal representation to the Bar Council of India in November 2025**, seeking a clear reaffirmation so that no student with a B.Com (A&F) degree would face this issue again.

---

## Institutional Responsiveness That Matters

At this crucial juncture, **Mr. Suvir Sidhu, Member, Bar Council of India**, was kind enough to hear the grievance of students and ensure the matter received proper attention from the appropriate authority.

Such responsiveness deserves appreciation.
