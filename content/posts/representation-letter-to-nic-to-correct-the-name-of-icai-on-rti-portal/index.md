**Subject:** Suggestion to rectify the name of the Public Authority on the RTI Portal.

Respected sir/madam,

I’m writing this letter to bring to your notice of an error(s) found in the name of the public authority on the RTI portal https://rtionline.gov.in/.

While we are filing online RTI application at this portal https://rtionline.gov.in in the Search Public Authority field if we type the keyword as ICAI, the following public authority name is displayed The Institute of Cost Accountants of India by default.

I invite your kind attention to the keyword ICAI where it represents the public authority the Institute of Chartered Accountant of India but not the ICMAI.

And, the name of following public authorities displayed on the RTI portal is incorrect, request you to correct the same.

| S.No | Name of the Public Authority (as per RTI Portal) | Keyword | Correct Name of the Public Authority | Source |
|-----:|-----------------------------------------------|---------|-------------------------------------|--------|
| 1 | Institute of Chartered Accoutant of India | ICAI | The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India | https://www.icai.org |
| 2 | The Institute of Cost Accountants of India | ICMAI | The Institute of Cost Accountants of India | https://icmai.in |
| 3 | Institute of Companies Secretaries of India | ICSI | The Institute of Company Secretaries of India | https://www.icsi.edu |

To avoid any confusion in the eyes of the stakeholders, I am writing this representation letter to your office to correct this default setting.

I request your office to do the needful by rectifying the same on the aforesaid website at the earliest. Should you require any additional information or assistance please contact the undersigned.

**PLEASE ACKNOWLEDGE THE RECEIPT OF THIS LETTER AT YOUR OFFICE.**

Respectfully,  
**B Vinay Reddy**
