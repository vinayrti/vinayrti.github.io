It is deeply concerning that **ICSI, an institution that positions itself as a messenger and guardian of good corporate governance**, is itself indulging in practices that raise serious questions of **misgovernance and lack of transparency**.

---

## Background of the RTI Application

Mr. **Prashanth Rangu** filed an application under the **Right to Information Act, 2005**, seeking **specific information relating to the revenue figures of ICSI**, particularly revenue generated through **certified copies provided to students over the last 10 years**.

The request was:
- **Record-based**
- **Financial in nature**
- Sought **in the manner the information is maintained by ICSI**

---

## Denial by the CPIO

The **Central Public Information Officer (CPIO) of ICSI** denied the information on the ground that:

> *“The information is not available in the form/content as desired by the applicant.”*

This response is troubling because:
- The applicant had **explicitly requested information in the manner maintained by ICSI**
- No request was made for creation or compilation of new data
- The denial defeats the very spirit of the RTI Act

---

## First Appeal and FAA Order

Aggrieved by the denial, the applicant **preferred a First Appeal** before the **First Appellate Authority (FAA) of ICSI**.

The appellant was represented by **Advocate Abhinav Singh** during the hearing.

As expected, the **FAA mechanically concurred with the submissions of the CPIO**, without independently examining:
- Availability of financial records
- Statutory obligations under the RTI Act
- The inconsistency with disclosures made by peer institutions

A copy of the **FAA order is attached for reference**.

## Serious Questions That Arise

This case raises **important and unavoidable questions**:

### 1️⃣ Availability of Revenue Data  
When ICSI operates on a **digital accounting system** and receives payments **primarily through online modes**, how can such basic **revenue information not be available** with the public authority?

### 2️⃣ Unequal Transparency Among Professional Bodies  
When **similar information is being disclosed by fellow professional bodies such as ICAI and ICMAI**, on what legal or administrative basis is **ICSI denying the same information**?

---

## Pattern of Denial by ICSI

This is **not an isolated instance**.

ICSI has **denied information in reply to at least five other RTI applications**, which sought data relating to:
- Verification of marks  
- Inspection of certified copies  
- Examination-related transparency  

Such repeated denials point towards a **systemic resistance to transparency**, rather than an isolated lapse.

---

## Conclusion

An institution that teaches and promotes **good corporate governance** must itself adhere to:
- **Transparency**
- **Accountability**
- **Statutory compliance**

Denial of basic financial and examination-related information under the RTI Act undermines not only the **credibility of ICSI**, but also the confidence of students and stakeholders.

If professional bodies are allowed to selectively disclose information, the **very objective of the RTI Act, 2005 stands diluted**.

*Good governance cannot be preached without being practiced.*
