Most Indians buy insurance once—and truly understand it only when a claim is rejected. Advertising focuses on cheap premiums, celebrities, and large numbers, while real problems lie hidden in fine print, definitions, and claim-time interpretation. Over multiple **Term Insurance and Health Insurance masterclasses**, claims discussions, and real-life disputes, one truth became clear:

> **Insurance failure is rarely about buying a policy. It is about buying the *wrong* policy, in the *wrong* way.**

This guide is written using the **entire learning from those sessions**, including:

* Expert explanations
* Real claim rejection stories
* Practical mistakes people make
* Hidden clauses insurers rely on
* IRDAI-regulated realities

It is intentionally detailed, because insurance is a *once-in-a-decade decision* with lifelong consequences.

# PART A — TERM (LIFE) INSURANCE

## 1. What life insurance actually protects

Life insurance is not about death—it is about **income continuity**. When a breadwinner is no longer around, the family does not lose emotions alone; it loses:

* Monthly income
* Loan repayment capacity
* Long-term financial stability

A correct life insurance policy ensures:

* Home loans do not become a burden
* Children’s education is uninterrupted
* Spouse does not face financial dependency
* Parents are not left vulnerable

You are not planning for death. You are protecting the **life you are building today**.

---

## 2. Types of life insurance — what to avoid and why

### ❌ Endowment policies

Endowment policies promise “guaranteed returns” but combine insurance and savings in the most inefficient way:

* Very low life cover
* Poor returns compared to even basic investments
* High commissions baked into premiums

### ❌ ULIPs

ULIPs mix insurance with market-linked investments:

* Complex structures
* High charges in early years
* Lock-in periods
* Difficult to evaluate real returns

### ✅ Term insurance (the only rational choice)

Term insurance is pure protection:

* No savings component
* No maturity benefit
* Maximum life cover at lowest cost

**Golden rule:** Never mix insurance with investment.

---

## 3. How much term cover do you actually need?

The most practical rule discussed repeatedly:

**Term Cover = 20–25 × Annual Income**

Example:

* Annual income ₹10 lakh → Term cover ₹2–2.5 crore

Why this range matters:

* Accounts for inflation
* Covers long-term dependents
* Provides buffer for emergencies

Avoid under-insuring simply to save premium.

---

## 4. Policy duration — a commonly ignored mistake

Many people buy term plans till age 50 or 55 to reduce premium. This is a mistake.

* Minimum recommended cover: **till 60–65 years**
* Extend to 70 if dependents rely longer

Insurance should last until your **financial responsibilities end**, not when premium feels uncomfortable.

---

## 5. Riders — useful vs unnecessary

### Reasonable rider

* Accidental death benefit (optional, limited value)

### Riders to generally avoid

* Return of premium (ROP)
* Income riders
* Market-linked riders

These inflate premiums without proportionate benefit.

---

## 6. Claim settlement — the uncomfortable truth

High claim settlement ratios advertised by insurers do not reflect **ease of claim**. From session experience:

* Most rejections arise from **non-disclosure**
* Insurers rely on definitions and medical history

**Rule:** Disclose every medical detail, even if it feels minor or old.

---

# PART B — HEALTH INSURANCE

## 7. Why buying health insurance early changes everything

Health insurance punishes delay.

Buying early ensures:

* Lower premiums
* Minimal exclusions
* Waiting periods finish while you are healthy
* Lifetime renewability without restrictions

Corporate insurance alone is a **temporary safety net**, not long-term protection.

---

## 8. Waiting periods — the backbone of health insurance

Every policy has three layers of waiting periods:

1. **Initial 30 days** – only accidents covered
2. **2 years** – specific listed illnesses (hernia, cataract, stones, knee replacement)
3. **3 years** – pre-existing diseases (BP, diabetes, thyroid, cholesterol)

Buying early ensures these periods pass *before* risk increases.

---

## 9. Corporate vs retail health insurance — the vehicle analogy

### Corporate policy (two-wheeler)

* Useful for short-term use
* Ends when employment ends
* Heavy sub-limits
* Weak in critical illness

### Retail policy (four-wheeler)

* Lifetime protection
* Better features
* Greater claim stability

**Use both, but never rely only on corporate cover.**

---

## 10. The three clauses that silently destroy claims

### ❌ Co-payment

Even 10–20% co-pay can mean lakhs from your pocket during hospitalization.

### ❌ Room rent restriction

Triggers proportionate deduction across the entire bill—not just room charges.

### ❌ Disease-wise sub-limits

Large cover advertised, tiny payouts during real illness.

**These three clauses should be avoided at all costs.**

---

## 11. Features that actually protect you

### No-claim bonus (NCB)

Automatically increases coverage every claim-free year.

### Unlimited restoration

Refills sum insured repeatedly, including for the same illness, without delay.

### Pre & post-hospitalisation

Covers tests, medicines, physiotherapy beyond hospital walls.

### Daycare coverage

Essential for modern treatments that don’t require 24-hour admission.

---

## 12. Daycare vs OPD — a critical distinction

* OPD = routine doctor visits (usually excluded)
* Daycare = advanced procedures under 24 hours (must be covered)

---

## 13. Parents’ health insurance — where most mistakes happen

Key realities:

* Parents usually have BP, diabetes, cholesterol
* These fall under 3-year PED waiting period
* Major illnesses are often linked to these conditions

Guidelines:

* Disclose everything
* Choose separate policy for parents
* Above 65, ₹5–10 lakh cover may be realistic

---

## 14. Family floater vs individual policies

* Self + spouse + children → family floater
* Parents → separate
* Similar-age parents → floater can work

Unlimited restoration makes floaters safer than before.

---

## 15. Maternity insurance — why it rarely makes sense

Private maternity add-ons:

* High premium
* Low caps (₹25k–₹50k)
* Long waiting periods
* ICU complications still capped

Better strategies:

* Use corporate maternity benefits
* Save separately via SIP

---

## 16. Choosing the right insurer — ignore marketing

Misleading claims:

* “97% cashless approval”
* “₹237/month premium”

What actually matters:

* IRDAI 3-year claim data
* Complaint ratios
* Hospital network near home

---

## 17. Claim stories — why expertise matters

### Case 1: Child’s thyroid cyst

Claim rejected using wordplay. Escalated legally. Settled before court hearing.

### Case 2: Parent’s ₹4 lakh claim

Rejected on fine print. Fought for 1.5 years. Claim overturned.

These cases show insurers test how far customers will push.

---

## 18. Why claims get rejected most often

1. Non-disclosure
2. Claim during waiting period
3. Late intimation (>30 days)
4. Policy lapse
5. Sub-limit violations

---

## 19. Moratorium period — your strongest legal shield

After **5 continuous years**, insurers cannot reject claims except for fraud or exclusions.

Continuity is power.

---

## 20. Multi-year policies — a smart optimisation

2–3 year policies:

* Offer discounts
* Lock premiums
* Prevent lapse
* Speed moratorium protection

---
