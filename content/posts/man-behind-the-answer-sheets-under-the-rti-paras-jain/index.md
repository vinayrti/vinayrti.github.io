If you are accessing **certified copies under the RTI free of cost**, you must be thankful to **Adv. Paras Jain** for his tireless and persistent efforts.

## Acknowledging Adv. Paras Jain

**Paras Jain** is an advocate practising in Delhi, known for his ability and passion to resolve complex and high-stake legal disputes. At a young age, he has successfully litigated several public causes relating to **students’ rights and consumers’ rights** before the **Supreme Court of India, Delhi High Court, and Consumer Forums** (District, State, and National).

His **landmark legal battle against ICAI, ICSI, ICWAI, CBSE, and Delhi University**, which established that evaluated answer scripts are *information* accessible under the RTI Act, is widely recognised across India. Because of these efforts, students today enjoy access to certified copies at a nominal cost, bringing much-needed **transparency and accountability** to the examination system.

I remain deeply indebted to him for his guidance and timely support.
