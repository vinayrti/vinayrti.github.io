Dear Friends,

One important point that every RTI applicant must know is that **there is no prescribed or mandatory application format under the Right to Information Act, 2005**.

Earlier, I had shared an RTI application format based on the **CBSE model**, which was **lengthy**. Many applicants later informed me that they were facing **validation errors while submitting the RTI application on the RTI Online Portal**:

👉 https://rtionline.gov.in/

---

## Why a New Format Was Needed

To avoid these technical issues and simplify the process, I personally had a **telephonic conversation with the CPIO of ICAI**, noted down the **exact minimum details required**, and prepared a **short and portal-friendly RTI application format**.

This format:
- Works smoothly on the RTI Online portal  
- Avoids unnecessary text and legal jargon  
- Is sufficient to obtain **certified copies of answer sheets**  

---

## How to Use This Format

👉 **Copy-paste the text below** into the field **“Text for RTI Application”** on the RTI Online portal and fill in your personal details.
