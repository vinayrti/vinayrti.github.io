## How CA Students Can Get Their Answer Sheets PDF for FREE under RTI Act (Step-by-Step Guide)

### 🪶 Introduction

Every CA student deserves to know how their papers were evaluated — and the **Right to Information (RTI) Act, 2005** makes that possible for **FREE**.  

In this guide, I’ll show you exactly how to get certified copies of your **ICAI answer sheets in PDF format**, step by step, through the official **RTI Online Portal** — without paying a single rupee to ICAI or any third party.

---

## ⚖️ Legal Basis — Know Who Made This Possible!

Before you begin, let’s acknowledge the judgments that made this transparency possible.  
The right to access evaluated answer sheets was established by two landmark **Supreme Court of India** rulings that strengthened students’ rights under the RTI Act.

### **1️⃣ Central Board of Secondary Education (CBSE) v. Aditya Bandopadhyay & Ors.**
**Civil Appeal No. 6454 of 2011 | [2011 (8) SCC 497]**

In this landmark judgment, the Hon’ble Supreme Court held that *evaluated answer sheets are “information”* within the meaning of **Section 2(f)** of the RTI Act.  
It affirmed that every student has the right to inspect or obtain copies of their own evaluated answer books from examining bodies such as CBSE, universities, and professional institutes.

### **2️⃣ Institute of Company Secretaries of India (ICSI) v. Paras Jain**  
**Civil Appeal No. 5665 of 2014**

This judgment reaffirmed the CBSE ruling and clarified that examining bodies **cannot charge arbitrary or excessive fees** beyond what the RTI Rules prescribe.  
The Supreme Court directed ICSI to provide certified copies at the nominal cost allowed under RTI, ensuring fairness and accessibility.

**Thanks to these two rulings**, students of professional institutes like ICAI, ICSI, and ICMAI can now request **certified copies of evaluated answer sheets under RTI**.  
ICAI has implemented this by providing **free PDF copies** through the RTI Online Portal, eliminating all per-page fees.
