*When citizens wait endlessly for information that legally belongs to them, frustration slowly turns into silence. But sometimes, accountability does arrive — quietly, firmly, and with real consequences.*

The **Right to Information Act, 2005** was born out of a simple democratic promise: *the citizen has the right to know*.  
Yet anyone who has filed an RTI knows the uncomfortable truth — applications go unanswered, appellate orders are ignored, and officials often behave as if time itself will erase responsibility.

In **October 2025**, the **Telangana Information Commission (TGIC)** reminded public authorities of a basic but often forgotten principle:

> **Delay is not immunity. Silence is not compliance.**

And it did so in the most effective way possible — by **putting a monetary cost on administrative apathy**.

## Years Passed. Orders Ignored. Citizens Kept Waiting.

Across a series of complaints decided by TGIC, the facts followed a depressingly familiar pattern:

- RTI appeals were allowed as early as **2021 and 2022**
- Clear directions were issued to supply information
- **Three to four years passed** without compliance
- Public Information Officers failed to appear before hearings
- Citizens were left running from office to office, despite winning their cases on paper

At some point, a painful question arises for every RTI user:

> *If even orders of the Information Commission are ignored, where does a citizen go?*

In these cases, TGIC answered that question — decisively.

## When the Commission Spoke, It Spoke Clearly

### **Jagtial Municipality: Three Cases, One Pattern of Neglect**

In **Complaint Nos. 482/2022, 3053/2022 and 3054/2022**, the Municipal Commissioner / Public Information Officer of Jagtial Municipality failed to implement appellate orders passed way back in **2021–2022**.

There was:
- No information  
- No compliance  
- No appearance before the Commission  

TGIC had seen enough.

**Outcome:**
- ₹2,000 compensation awarded **in each case**

### **Karimnagar: Shared Power, Shared Responsibility**

In **Complaint No. 14909/2022**, the matter involved three authorities — the Mandal Praja Parishad, the Tahsildar, and the Panchayat Secretary.

Even after a survey was conducted pursuant to earlier Commission orders, the **survey report was never provided to the applicant**.

This time, responsibility could not be passed around.

**Outcome:**
- ₹6,000 compensation awarded (₹2,000 each from three authorities)

### **Siddipet: Panchayat Secretary Held Answerable**

In **Complaint Nos. 19865/2022 and 19868/2022**, Commission orders passed in **January 2022** were simply ignored for years.

**Outcome:**
- ₹5,000 compensation in **each case**

## A Quiet, Firm Hand at the Helm

All these orders were passed by **P. V. Srinivasa Rao, State Information Commissioner**.

There were no dramatic remarks. No rhetoric. Just a steady, principled approach grounded in the spirit of the RTI Act:

- Orders of the Commission are **not optional**
- Passage of time does **not erase accountability**
- Citizens must not suffer endlessly for official inaction

Most importantly, the Commission recognised a truth every RTI applicant understands instinctively:

> **Information delayed for years is justice denied — even if it is eventually supplied.**

The compensation awarded in these cases was not charity.  
It was an acknowledgment of the **citizen’s lost time, effort, and dignity**.

## Why These Orders Matter  

These are not routine RTI orders buried in a database. They quietly but firmly set important standards:

- Public authorities cannot simply *wait out* citizens
- Transfers and excuses do not dissolve liability
- Information Commissions **will enforce their authority**
- Persistence under the RTI Act still works

For RTI users, activists, lawyers, and even honest officers, these decisions restore faith that **the system still has a spine**.

## Final Thought

In an age where transparency is often promised but rarely practiced, the Telangana Information Commission has shown that:

> **Accountability does not need noise — it needs resolve.**

To the citizens who waited for years: **Your patience was acknowledged.**
  
To the officials who ignored lawful orders: **The bill has finally arrived.**
  
And to the Commission: **This is exactly how the RTI Act was meant to work**.
