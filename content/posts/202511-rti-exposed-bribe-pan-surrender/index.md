## A Battle Against Corruption: How a Citizen Used RTI to Expose a Bribe Demand

In an era when digital systems are designed to make government services transparent and efficient, corruption still finds ways to hide in the shadows. This is the story of how a citizen’s simple attempt to surrender a PAN card turned into a quiet yet powerful stand against bribery — and how the Right to Information (RTI) Act became the tool that ensured justice prevailed.

### The Beginning
In November 2024, a citizen decided to surrender their PAN (Permanent Account Number) for personal reasons. Since possessing multiple PANs is illegal, the process was meant to be straightforward: fill out the form, submit it, and wait for official processing.

But what happened next revealed a darker side of the system.

Instead of handling the request professionally, the Income Tax officer responsible demanded a bribe of ₹15,000 to “complete the process.” For someone who had followed every rule, the demand was shocking — a harsh reminder that even in a digital age, corruption can persist behind bureaucratic walls.

### Taking a Stand
Rather than giving in, the citizen chose integrity over convenience.  
In January 2025, they filed a Right to Information (RTI) application seeking:

- The current status of their PAN surrender request  
- Reasons for the delay  
- Any internal notes or correspondence related to the case  

It was not an act of aggression — just a calm, firm request for transparency.

That simple action changed everything.

### The Outcome
Once the RTI application reached the department, the system was compelled to respond.  
An internal inquiry was initiated, and soon, the truth surfaced — the officer had indeed acted unethically. The department took swift corrective measures:

- The newly created duplicate PAN (issued due to the mishandling) was cancelled  
- The official records were corrected  
- The surrender request was lawfully processed  

What began as a frustrating ordeal ended as a victory for transparency and accountability.

### Why This Matters
This story shows how one individual, using the power of the RTI Act, can challenge corruption without confrontation. It doesn’t always take protests or legal battles — sometimes, asking the right question through the right channel is enough to bring light where there’s darkness.

The RTI Act, 2005 gives every Indian citizen the right to seek information, question delays, and hold public servants accountable. When used fearlessly, it becomes one of the strongest tools for justice in a democracy.

### A Message to Every Citizen
The fight against corruption is ongoing, and every small act of courage counts.  
If you ever find yourself in a similar situation — don’t pay, don’t give up.  

**File an RTI. Ask questions. Demand accountability.**

Let transparency be your weapon and truth your shield.
