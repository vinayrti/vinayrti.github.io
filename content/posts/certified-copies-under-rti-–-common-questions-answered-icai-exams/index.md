Dear Friends,

I am receiving a large number of messages and emails from students reporting that **certified copies under RTI have not been received even after 30 days** from the date of filing the RTI application. Many are also worried about the **possibility of decrease of marks due to suo-motu verification by ICAI**.

In this article, I attempt to address the **most common queries raised by students**. Before commenting or raising doubts, I request you to kindly read the article in full.

At the outset, I must acknowledge **Paras Jain** — a name every student accessing certified copies under RTI should remember. Due to his tireless efforts and the **Supreme Court judgment in *ICSI vs Paras Jain***, students today enjoy this benefit, which not only saves hard-earned money but also brings much-needed transparency to the examination system. I remain indebted for his guidance and timely support.

## 1. RTI Act mandates 30 days, but certified copies not received even after 30 days?

Yes. As per **Section 7(1) of the RTI Act, 2005**, information must be supplied **within 30 days** from the date of receipt of the RTI application. This period **includes Sundays and public holidays**.

However, this time an unusually large number of students applied for certified copies. As on date:

- More than **35,000 RTI applications** were filed with ICAI  
- Approximately **1,45,000+ answer sheets** (average 4 papers per student)  
- All answer sheets require **suo-motu verification**, scanning, and uploading  

Because of this volume, a **slight delay** may occur.

As per a **telephonic conversation with the CPIO of ICAI**, students are advised to:
- Wait for **3–5 additional days** after completion of 30 days  
- If still not received, **file a First Appeal on the RTI portal**
- Meanwhile, send a **reminder email** to the concerned CPIO mentioning the RTI application number
