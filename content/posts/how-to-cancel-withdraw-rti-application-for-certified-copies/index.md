In my previous blog post, I have attached a reply from the ICAI under RTI, where it was clearly mentioned **MARKS WON'T BE DECREASED on suo-motu verification,** but few students are still worried about it and want to check if there is an possibility to cancel the RTI application.

As per the provisions of the Right to Information Act, 2005, there is no concept of withdrawal or cancellation of the RTI application once it was filed with the public authority. The reason behind this was to protect the interest of the RTI applicant. Activists also say that provisions for withdrawal of RTI applications will give those with vested interests an opportunity to exert undue pressure on them.

**But you can write a letter or mail to the CPIO that the information sought in the application is not required by you anymore and the application be treated as disposed of.**

**Ms. Pooja Kedia**, a student of the ICAI filed an application for certified copies under the RTI, later changed her mind and sent a request to CPIO on mail. CPIO accepted her request and disposed of the RTI application without providing the certified copies.

**Reply by the CPIO of ICAI :-**  
**As per your request your RTI application has been canceled.**

I suggest you send a **LETTER** in the below format to the CPIO and a soft copy on e-mail, as CPIO will receive hundreds of mail every day, there may be a possibility where your mail went unread.
